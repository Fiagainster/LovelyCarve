// Aggregate entry point for the IPC service layer. Import domain namespaces
// (`import { fs } from '../lib/ipc'`) or pull functions directly from the
// domain modules (`import { fsChildren } from '../lib/ipc/fs'`).
//
// Domain modules are intentionally split by concern rather than collapsed
// into one god file — add a new sibling module per backend domain.
